- **FlutterFlow**: For building the user interface using drag and drop.
- **Firebase Firestore**: For database and real-time syncing.
- **Google Maps API**: For location-based features.

## Architecture
The app follows **Clean Architecture**, with three main layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - Handles the user interface and navigation (Jetpack Compose screens).
2. **Domain Layer**:
    - Manages business logic and use cases(model and viewModel).
3. **Data Layer**:
    - Communicates with Firebase Firestore for CRUD operations(repository).

# KisanSwap
